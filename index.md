An introduction to large-scale distributed systems with an emphasis on big-data processing and storage infrastructures. Topics include fundamental tradeoffs in distributed systems, techniques for exploiting parallelism, big-data computation and storage models, design and implementation of various well-known distributed systems infrastructures, and concrete exposure to programming big-data applications on top popular, open-source infrastructures for data processing and storage systems.  

The course is co-taught by  Sambit Sahu (IBM TJ Watson researcher and CS affiliated faculty), and Eugene Wu (Assistant Prof. in CS). 
Sahu will teach fundamental concepts of distributed systems, along with the tradeoffs that arise, and various distributed computation models, along with concrete examples of open-source big-data technologies and how they can be programmed.  Wu will teach concepts of data modeling, storage, and visualization, along with the tradeoffs they raise.

## Grading

The grading formula is:

* 85%: Homework
* 15%: Class participation (ask/answer questions)

A [project](./proposals) can be done in lieu of 3 assignments

## Prerequisites:

* Java/Scala/Python programming.  Python is required, Scala will make the spark assignments easier.

## Textbooks

We're recommending the following two reference texts, which cover some of the big-data technologies with which students will be interacting in the course:
